This extension is a work in progress. It currently works, but could us some UI improvements. 
Future updates:
	* Include a forecast of the UV Index over the course of the day.
	* Paginate the popup to include the current, forecasted, and legend.
	* Make new icons and banners (rebrand).
	* Add the ability to set your own location.

This extension works by using the UV Index API provided by [the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/web-services).
